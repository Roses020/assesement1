//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const Analysis =" The analysis stage involves defining project goals as functions. "
 const design =" Is an essential phase of the Software Development Life Cycle. The list of requirements that you develop in the definition phase is used to make design choices. In the design phase, one or more designs are created to achieve the project result"
const implementaions = "This phase details the who, what, when and how much of your communication strategy. The plan covers partner roles and responsibilities, activities, timeline, budget and management considerations. "
const testing = "Is a process used to test software and ensure that quality standards are met. Tests are carried out systematically over several phases"
const maintenance = "Its main purpose is to modify and update software application after delivery to correct faults and to improve performance."
